                        He was the strongest shinobi, Hashirama Senju 
                        was the first Hokage. Also, Hashirama was an 
                        unbeatable force during his era. At the same 
                        time, Hashirama wanted peace around the shinobi 
                        world. Hence, he formed the Leaf Village along 
                        with Madara Uchiha. However, the Uchiha and the Senjus were 
                        not able to stand each other. Thus, Hashirama had to defeat Madara.

                        Naruto Uzumaki, our beloved protagonist.

                        man in the village was a thrilling roller coaster ride.
                        Uchiha Sasuke,
                        Madara once said he would’ve used Sasuke instead of Obito if he was
                        born some years ago. Sasuke’s growth has been humongous as the only 
                        alive Uchiha left in the Naruto series. Also, he was one of the
                        greatest assets during the 4th Great Ninja War.

                        since his debut in the series. Not only did he kill 
                        over 3000 Shinobis on his 1st day in the 4th Ninja War,
                        but he also almost eliminated the whole Shinobi Alliance.
                        Featuring the Uchihas, Madara has been the most powerful 
                        among them. Though he couldn’t defeat Hashrirama during
                        his lifetime, he 
                        certainly could after becoming the ten tails Jinchuriki.

                        Since the beginning of Naruto’s timelines, 
                        it’s always been a battle between two strong
                        ninjas, whether we consider Asura/Indra,
                        Madara/Hashirama, or Naruto/Sasuke. 
                        The same theory stands with Hagoromo
                        and Hamura Otsutsuki- the children 
                        of Kaguya Otsutsuki. Again, the brothers 
                        held the powers of Otsutsuki and were the ones
                        through which the Earth gained Chakra.

                        the Shinobi world with imminent force. It’s 
                        undeniable that anyone in the Naruto series 
                        could’ve faced her head-on and had won the 
                        battle. Conclusively, Kaguya is the most
                        vital and Strongest Character in the Naruto Series.

                <h4>Senju Clan </h4>
                <p>
                    The Senju clan descends from the second
                    son of the Rikudô Sennin, who received the sage's body inheriting his strength, 
                    willpower, and physical energy from the sage. He believed that to maintain 
                    peace, love was necessary. The sage favored the ideals of his younger son over
                    those of his eldest son who believed that only power could bring peace, therefore,
                    the Rikudō Sennin on his deathbed chose his younger son as his successor.

                <h4>Uchiha Clan</h4>
                <p>
                    The Uchiha clan descends in direct line from Indra,
                    the first son of Rikudo. From the latter they obtained a 
                    fearsome pupil, the Sharingan . The Uchiha are very 
                    intertwined and advocate the deepening of their 
                    abilities in order to strive for power and perfection.

                <h4>Hyūga Clan</h4>
                <p>
                    The Hyūga clan are descendants from the 
                    Ōtsutsuki clan, specifically from Hamura 
                    Ōtsutsuki's lineage. As a result, 
                    they are also distant cousins of the Uchiha, 
                    Senju, Uzumaki, and Kaguya clans.
                    They are considered to be one of, 
                    if not currently, the most powerful clan in Konohagakure. 
                    Their fame and prowess stretches far and wide, 
                    leading others to both praise and covet their abilities.

                <p>
                    The Sarutobi Clan (猿飛一族, Sarutobi Ichizoku) is an 
                    influential clan from Konohagakure. It has produced 
                    several renowned members who have held positions of
                    high authority, including the Third Hokage; whose son, 
                    Asuma, held membership in the Twelve Guardian Ninja, 
                    while his other child served
                    directly under the Hokage along with their spouse as Anbu.[1]
                    All known members have also been devout observers of the Will of Fire.
